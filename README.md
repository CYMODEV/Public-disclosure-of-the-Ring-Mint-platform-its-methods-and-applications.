# Ring Mint — Secure Printable Token Platform
**Public Disclosure (Patent Pending)**

## Abstract
Ring Mint is a platform for minting **secure, printable, cryptographically signed tokens** that function as bearer or named instruments. Each token combines a **canonical signed payload** with a **visual trust layer**: a deterministic **chromatic ring glyph**, pixelated hologram overlays, and human‑readable fallback codes. Tokens can be printed, displayed on screens, or transmitted optically, acoustically, or via NFC. They are verifiable offline and redeemable online, bridging digital ledgers with physical workflows.

## Background
Traditional vouchers, checks, and gift cards lack cryptographic guarantees. Digital tokens require connectivity and specialized wallets. Ring Mint addresses this gap by providing **tangible, verifiable, and brandable instruments** that can be issued by banks, employers, event organizers, or custodians, and verified by merchants or recipients without continuous internet access.

## Summary of the Invention
- **Canonical Payload**: JSON object containing type, amount, currency, issuer ID, note ID, nonce, TTL, and metadata.
- **Envelope**: Signed (ECDSA P‑256) and optionally encrypted (AES‑GCM) wrapper.
- **Visual Renderer**: Generates a deterministic chromatic ring SVG with:
  - Segments colored from payload digest
  - Alignment ticks for optical pose estimation
  - Pixelated hologram microgrid overlay
  - Center glyph for issuer branding
- **Verification Module**: Offline/online verification of signature, TTL, nonce, and conditions.
- **Redemption Protocol**: Atomic marking of notes as spent, with receipts and audit logs.
- **Use Cases**: Cashier’s checks, money orders, payroll tokens, gift cards, RWA receipts, lottery tickets, provenance certificates, insurance drafts, and more.

## Example Applications
- **Financial Instruments**: cashier’s checks, money orders, paychecks, escrow receipts.
- **Consumer**: gift cards, event passes, lottery tickets.
- **Enterprise**: supply‑chain provenance, title transfer slips, IP receipts.
- **Aid & Relief**: offline vouchers for NGOs, micro‑credit notes.
- **Creative**: limited edition art certificates, royalties
